Hip-hop has been more than just a genre for me - it's a powerful medium that allows me to express my identity, tell stories, and connect with people across cultures. Music is not just my passion, it's the language through which I communicate my experiences, dreams, and the rich Kurdish heritage that shapes who I am.",
